```

## Segregation Classification

For more my homepage see <http://jeremyspater.com>.

We would like a method for classifying neighborhoods as **segregated** or not. This is a problem with many real-world applications in social science.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
